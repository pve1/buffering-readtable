* Buffering readtable

Creates a readtable that buffers all input from a non-interactive
stream passed to READ. The input can be transformed before being
returned by READ.

Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (let ((*readtable* (make-buffering-readtable
                      :translate-all (lambda (forms)
                                       (append forms (list 'extra))))))
    (with-input-from-string (s "a b c")
      (list (read s)
            (read s)
            (read s)
            (read s))))

=> (A B C EXTRA)
#+END_SRC
